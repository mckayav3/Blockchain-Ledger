# Module_18_Challenge: Blockchain Ledger

This application uses Stremlit to create a blockchain ledger. The ledger records the transactions that are saved to the blockchain. Each transaction has a sender, receiver, and an amount of money that is transferred between the two. The ledger also validates each transaction.
